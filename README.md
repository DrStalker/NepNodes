# NepNodes

These are personal nodes for ComfyUI, often for a very speciifc purpose that wouldn't make sense in anyone elses workflow.

Some of these are copied from custom node collections where I only wanted one specific tiny thing.



## WAN Resolutions (Nep)

Outputs some pre-configured resolutions I use in WAN

## XOR (Nep)

XOR two integers. 

## Remove First or Last From Batch (Nep)

Removes teh first or last image from a batch of images. Useful for WAN where the first image is not part of the video (e.g.: start a prompt with "Immediately cut to a new scene where teh exact same person...")

## Resolution from Ratio (Nep)

Give it an aspect ratio, the number of megapixels, and landscape/portait and it will spit out the desired heght and width.  Rounded to the nearest 4, which may be required but even if it isn't then it makes teh numbers look nicer.
