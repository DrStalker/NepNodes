# NepNodes

These are personal nodes for ComfyUI, often for a very speciifc purpose that wouldn't make sense in anyone elses workflow.

Some of these are copied from custom node collections where I only wanted one specific tiny thing, some were written for a specific use case.



## WAN Resolutions 

Outputs some pre-configured resolutions I use in WAN

## XOR 

XOR two integers. 

## Resolution from Ratio

Give it an aspect ratio, the number of megapixels, and landscape/portait and it will spit out the desired heght and width.  Rounded to the nearest 4, which may be required but even if it isn't then it makes teh numbers look nicer.

## Some style stuff

For applying styles from a list stored in style_presets.py.  

## Float rounder

To stop ComfyUI using .249999999999 instead of .25 which is a probelm when you want to embed the number in the image or filename.

## Regexp 

Regualr expression substrtution with no guardrails or ease-of-use features.

## A bunch of very specific stuff that I had a use for at some point

Have fun.
